## Inspiration
My inspiration is the millions of people who aren't as educated when it comes to important cybersecurity topics. They stand at risk for themselves and everybody on their network.
## What it does
My project sends allows an employer to enter the email of someone who works for them. The application will send an generated phishing email to that employee. If the employee falls for that phishing attack it will alert the employer, and then educated the employee about a phishing attack; what it does, how to prevent it, etc. 
## How I built it
I built my application using C#, httphish, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used Visual Studio and a web browser.
## Challenges I ran into
I had to learn about Invokes in C#. I couldn't edit the UI in a thread that wasn't the same as the UI. I had to learn how to use Invokes.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud that I was able to figure out how to clone html using httphish. I am proud I could help people learn more about phishing attacks and social engineering. 
## What I learned
I learned more about httphish. I learned more about building Window Form Apps. 
## What's next for Hook Line and Sinker
Hopefully I can get it fully published!
